# Escape From Devlog
<h3> This is the official dev log for my upcoming game</h3>
<h5>The name is still a work in progress seeing as I don't actually have a name for where theyre escaping from</h5>

<p>Seeing as I don't actually want to run/moderate any social media account, I'm using my knowledge in web development to create a blog. <br>
This is purely for me to put updates on the progress of my game so I can feel like I'm progressing. <br>
Plus I think devlogs are cool, and self made blogs are cool, so why not combine the two and make my own devlog blog?</p>
