# EscapeDevlog
<h2> This is the official dev log for my upcoming game</h2>

<p>Seeing as I don't actually want to run/moderate any social media account, I'm using my knowledge in web development to create a blog. <br>
This is purely for me to put updates on the progress of my game so I can feel like I'm progressing. <br>
Plus I think devlogs are cool, and self made blogs are cool, so why not combine the two and make my own devlog blog?</p>

<small>Thank you for checking out my devlog</small>
